## DIE (Distributed Intelligence Experiement)

> Disclaimer: We are currently in the very early stages of development and have not yet completed the first version of the project

### About
The goal of this project is to create a web based simulation of distributed artificial intelligence for self assembling robots.  The 'Robots' of the experiment are rendered as squares in a grid and will need to communicate and think on their own to create patterns.  We hope to create a web service that will allow others to view the robots at work from their own computers.  The browser side of this project is located [here](https://github.com/joeross999/DIE-Front-End)

### Set Up
Currently you must run the server and the browser on your local machine for the simulation to wok. First clone both the API and the [Front End Repo](https://github.com/joeross999/DIE-Front-End) then run `npm install` in the api directory. Once the project has been set up, run `node app` to launch the server.  Then open the `index.html` file from the front end directory.
