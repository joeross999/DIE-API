# Distributed Intelligence Experiement
---
> Disclaimer: We are currently in the very early stages of development and have not yet completed the first version of the project

### About
The goal of this project is to create a web based simulation of distributed artificial intelligence for self assembling robots.  The 'Robots' of the experiment are rendered as squares in a grid and will need to communicate and think on their own to create patterns.  We hope to create a web service that will allow others to view the robots at work from their own computers.

### Set Up
Currently you must run the server and the browser on your local machine for the simulation to work.  First clone the project then run `npm install` in the directory that you cloned the project to. Once the project has been set up, run `node app` to launch the server. Then using your browser navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`
